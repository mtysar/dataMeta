\title{Build a linker data frame.}
\usage{
build_linker(
  my.data,
  variable_description,
  variable_type,
  variable_sensitive = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{my.data}{Data.frame. The data set for which the user is creating the 
dictionary for.}

\item{variable_description}{A string vector representing the different descriptions 
that the user will give to each variable name from the original dataset. These 
need to be in the same order as the original dataset's variable names.}

\item{variable_type}{A vector of integers with values 0 or 1, only. Use 0 for
variable names for which a range of values will be presented and 1 to show unique 
cases of each variable name option. See examples, below.}

\item{variable_sensitive}{An optional vector of integers with values 0 or 1, 
only. Use 0 for variables that contain sensitive information (e.g., personal 
health information).}
}
\value{
If the original dataset supplied as my.data is of class data.frame; 
the variable description items are in the same order as the orignal dataset's 
variable names; and the variable_type intgeer vector values are 0 or 1, then 
a small data frame is produced with variable_names, variable_description, 
variable_type columns. This dataframe will serve as a linker data frame to be 
able to construct the data dictionary.
}
\description{
\code{build_linker} constructs a data frame that will be an intermediary 
between the original dataset and the data dictionary. This is the first function 
used in this package. For the function to run, the following parameters are needed.

\examples{
# example original data set for which a dictionary will be made
data("esoph")
my.data <- esoph

# Add description for each variable names and variable type
variable_description <- c("age group", "alcohol consumption", "tobacco consumption", 
"number of cases", "number of controls")

variable_type <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

linker <- build_linker(my.data = my.data, variable_description = variable_description, 
variable_type = variable_type)
linker

\dontrun{
variable_description <- c("age group", "alcohol consumption", "tobacco consumption", 
"number of cases", "number of controls")
variable_type <- c(0, 2, 0, 0, 0)
linker <- build_linker(my.data = my.data, variable_description = variable_description, 
variable_type = variable_type)
linker
